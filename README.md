# OpenGL-Enviornment
Learning OpenGL fundamentals and math applications.
This project was created to teach me how the openGL library works, the pipeline behind opengl and the math applications such as quaternions and coordinate system. Project uses perlin noise to generate terrain according to settings specified. Just a sandbox enviornment.
